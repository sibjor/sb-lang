GENERAL SYNTAX:

This is my take on a syntax design. The current implementation is limited and will expand as the project evolves.
Data types provide a structured way to store data, ordered or keyed in specific patterns.

DATA TYPES:

* NULL (NULL):
    - Represents the absence of a value.
    - Example: 1 + a = NULL;

* Integer (int):
    - Stores whole numbers without decimals.
    - Example: int a = 160;

* Floating points (float):
    - Stores numbers with decimal points.
    - Example: float a = 19.204;

* Character (char):
    - Stores a single character.
    - Example: char a = 'q';

* Name (name):
    - A string-like type restricted to letters only; no numbers or symbols allowed.
    - The length is determined by encountering a non-name character such as whitespace or line start.
    - Example: name a = "Sixten";

* String (string):
    - A sequence of characters, capable of storing text of arbitrary length.
    - Example: string a = "Hello World!";

* Boolean (bool):
    - Stores one of two values: true or false. Defaults to false if unset.
    - Example: bool a = true;

* Array ([], []{}, [][]):
    - Stores multiple values of the same type in one or more dimensions.
    - Indexed starting at zero.
    - Examples:
        int[5] a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];                 # One-dimensional array of integers
        int[2][3] matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]];  # Two-dimensional array (matrix)
        bool[4] flags = [true, false, true, false]; # Array of booleans
        string[3] names = ["Anna", "Bob", "Cleo"];  # Array of strings

* Collection (coll):
    - Flexible container allowing mixed data types with indexed access.
    - Supports complex indexing schemes.
    - Examples:
        coll a = { 0: 42, "name": "Sixten", 2: true };
        coll matrix = { [0,0]: 1, [0,1]: 2, [1,0]: 3, [1,1]: 4 };

* Hash maps (map):
    - Stores key-value pairs with efficient lookup using hashing.
    - Keys are unique; values may be any type.
    - Internally uses hash functions to map keys to storage locations.
    - Collision resolution methods ensure reliable access.
    - Supports nesting of maps.
    - Examples:
        map<string, int> ages = { "John": 31, "Anna": 36 };
        map<int, map<string, float>> scores = {
            1: { "math": 95.5, "english": 88.0 },
            2: { "math": 78.0, "english": 91.2 }
        };
        map<string, map<string, bool>> permissions = {
            "admin": { "read": true, "write": true },
            "guest": { "read": true, "write": false }
        };

* Pointer (ptr<T>) (T*):
    - Stores the memory address of a value of type T.
    - Enables indirect access and manipulation of data.
    - Requires careful memory management to avoid errors.
    - Example: ptr<int> p = &a;   # Generic style
    - Example: int* p = &a;       # Classic C-style pointer syntax

* Reference (ref<T>) (T&):
    - Represents an alias to an existing value of type T.
    - Provides direct access without copying, safer and easier to use than pointers.
    - Cannot be null and must be initialized when declared.
    - Example: ref<int> r = a;    # Generic style
    - Example: int& r = a;        # Classic C++ reference syntax

* Function (func):
    - Represents executable code blocks that can be passed and invoked.
    - Example: func add = (int a, int b) -> int { return a + b; };

* Tuple:
    - Fixed-size ordered collection of elements of potentially different types.
    - Example: tuple<int, string, bool> person = (25, "Sixten", true);

* Enum:
    - Collection of named constant values.
    - Example: enum Color { Red, Green, Blue };

* Struct:
    - Aggregates related data fields into a single compound type.
    - Example: struct Point { int x; name y; name z;};
